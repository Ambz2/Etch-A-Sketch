# Etch-A-Sketch #


This project is an etch a sketch website. 

It will allow users to draw, as they mouse over a grid of squares each square will turn to a selected color.

Users will be able to select the size of the grid to a maximum of 100 squares, as well as the colour of the etch a sketch when they mouse over the grid. There will also be reset functionality.
